# Checkin

Remote-friendly scrum checkins without the annoying meetings.

An educational student app project originally designed for [Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott](https://ericelliottjs.com/).

## What's a Scrum Checkin?

In agile development, we strive to implement the minimum effective amount of process to enable [high velocity development](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-build-a-high-velocity-development-team-4b2360d34021).

The scrum meeting is a common element of that minimal process. Its purpose is to allow team members to check in with each other. On each work day, each small team gathers to answer three questions:

* What did you do on the last workday?
* What are you doing today?
* Is there anything blocking you?

Scrum teams should be small, so these meetings should last less than 15 minutes.

But what about distributed teams working in different timezones? And even a 15 minute meeting is still expensive. What if you could get even better visibility without the inefficiency of a meeting?

That's where this app comes in.

## UI

Here's a simple mock-up of the checkin feature:
